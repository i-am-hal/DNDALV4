# D&DAL ~ Version 4
## Dungeons & Dragons Automation Language
### A tool for a very lazy programmer.

#### What the heck is this?
D&DAL is a small program meant to emulate roll-20 style digital dice rolling.
It supports the typically used syntax of 1dN or NdM to denote dice rolls.
It also fully supports the basic arithmetic operators, allows for the creation
of variables, and maybe in the future text editing.

##### Why...? (Short Version)
After getting burned very badly by my first experience being a GM in D&D, I
sought to try to make my life as easier as I can manage. I was sick and
annoyed of having to manage and roll seventeen thousand million times with
physical dice for a horde of goblins. D&DAL allows me to quickly type out
a dice roll, and to get it.

##### How does it work???????
It's a REPL interface. You type.

```
> 1d6
Natural 6! x 1

>
```

Here we rolled a single d6, ... we know this because it was *1d6.*

###### *But I want a list of dice rolls!*
```
> 3d6
[1 4 2]

>
```

Yeah it's pretty easy actually. If in the notation of some number
greater than 1 of some dice, it will spit back the list of the rolls.
Note here, that it did not automatically take the sum of all these
values. To do that, (assuming we got the same rolls) we would use
*ds* (dice sum) instead of *d.*
